   card: a duotoned photograph of the market's own words at scale — a wall of
   thousands of verbatim notes — with the editor's pen laid over it. Two
   verbatims are pulled from the wall and pinned; a single red thread gathers
   them into the one perception the market holds but never said out loud.

   The photograph carries the *texture* of mass opinion; the annotations carry
   the *meaning*. Coordinates are percentages of the plate, tuned by eye against
   the composition (see HeroPhoto in types/index.ts). Swap `image.src` for any
   premium research photograph and the duotone + overlay treatment carries it. */
